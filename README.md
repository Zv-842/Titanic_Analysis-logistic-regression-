# "Titanic" dataset analysis (Logistic-regression)
Here I've made analysis of Titanic dataset. I choosed  binary Logistic regression. First, I made data exploratory, cleaning,also visualization (plots for increase the understanding level of the data)  and last but not least data analysis. 

Packages 
In this project I've used the next Python libraries:
Jupyter Notebooks
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn exactly: LogisticRegression, train_test_split, metrics, preprocessing, accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix

Results 
The classifier built here has a prediction score of 0.96, i.e., we get an average accuracy of 90+%. Really good score and accuracy. So, I could use it in the future.
